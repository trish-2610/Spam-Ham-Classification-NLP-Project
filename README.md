# üìß Spam-Ham Classification - NLP Project
## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying messages as Spam (unwanted messages) or Ham (legitimate messages) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to develop an efficient spam detection system to filter out unwanted messages.
### ‚ö°Project Steps
1. Data cleaning and Preprocessing using NLTK 
2. Applying Train Test Split using Scikit-learn
3. Text Processing ( sentences ---> vectors ) using BOW and TF-IDF
4. Model Training - Gaussian Naive Bayes ML Algorithm
5. Prediction and Accuracy ( Comparision between BOW and TF-IDF )
### ‚û°Ô∏è Result 
To predict whether an email is Spam or Ham(Not Spam).
